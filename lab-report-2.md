In my code, I created an ArrayList of all the words that would be added and needed to be printed on the screen. To print them out, I ran a for loop to go through the ArrayList and added all the words plus the new line character to a string which was eventually printed out.

Here is an example of the code working:

Here is another example of the code working again to demostrate that all words are printed:
